# tone-teacher
toneteacher is a supplementary application to neurotone devices. Neurotone was developed as an entry to the McMaster MEDSprint designathon/hackathon 
as an aid for parkinson's patients. Through bone conducting rhythmic audio cues and laser cues, neurotone helps snap the patient's freezes. Neurotone also helps
amplify the voice of parkinson's patients by having a built in adjustable bone conducting microphone. Tone teacher takes audio input from the neurotone
and analyzes it, providing tonality, clarity, and vocabulary feedback. Toneteacher helps parkinson's patients reclaim their communication confidence.
